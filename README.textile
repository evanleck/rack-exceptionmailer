h1. ExceptionMailer Rack Middleware

I made this because I felt the "rack-contrib version":https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/blob/master/lib/rack/contrib/mailexceptions.rb was needlessly complicated.

This version uses "Pony":https://github.com/benprew/pony and doesn't rely on any SMTP servers for sending.

h2. Usage

Include it in your config.ru like this (basic):

bq. use Rack::ExceptionMailer, :to => 'your.email@yourdomain.com'

Or, with more than one email address to send to and a customized subject:

bq. use Rack::ExceptionMailer,
	:to => ['evan.lecklider@gmail.com', 'another.email@yourdomain.com'],
	:subject => 'Error Occurred in Rack Application'


Or with full config:

bq. use Rack::ExceptionMailer, 
	:to => ['evan.lecklider@gmail.com', 'another.email@yourdomain.com'], 
	:from => 'errors@yourdomain.com', 
	:subject => 'Error Occurred in Rack Application'



h2. Testing

I haven't written any tests for this yet but it does work well as long as you have mail installed on your machine.
