h1. ExceptionMailer Rack Middleware

I made this because I felt the "rack-contrib version":https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/blob/master/lib/rack/contrib/mailexceptions.rb was needlessly complicated.

This version uses "Pony":https://github.com/benprew/pony and doesn't rely on any SMTP servers for sending.
