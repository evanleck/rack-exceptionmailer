h1. ExceptionMailer Rack Middleware

I made this because I felt the "rack-contrib version":https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/blob/master/lib/rack/contrib/mailexceptions.rb was needlessly complicated.

This version uses "Pony":https://github.com/benprew/pony and doesn't rely on any SMTP servers for sending.

h2. Usage

Include it in your config.ru like this (basic):

<pre>use Rack::ExceptionMailer, :to => 'your.email@yourdomain.com'</pre>

Or, with more than one email address to send to and a customized subject:

<pre>
use Rack::ExceptionMailer,
  :to => ['your.email@yourdomain.com', 'another.email@yourdomain.com'],
  :subject => 'Error Occurred in Rack Application'
</pre>

Or with full config:

<pre>
use Rack::ExceptionMailer, 
  :to => ['your.email@yourdomain.com', 'another.email@yourdomain.com'], 
  :from => 'errors@yourdomain.com', 
  :subject => 'Error Occurred in Rack Application'
</pre>

h2. Testing

I haven't written any tests for this yet but it does work well as long as you have mail installed on your machine.
